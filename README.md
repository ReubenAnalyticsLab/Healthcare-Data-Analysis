### Project Overview

This data analsyis aims to provide insights into the sales performance of an e-commerce company over the past year. By analyzing various aspects of the sales data, we seek to identify trends, make data-driven recommendation, and gain a deeper understanding of the company's performance.

### Data Sources

Sales Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "sales_data.csv" file, containing detailed information about each sale made by the company.

### Tools

- Excel -  Data Cleaning
   - [Download here](https://microsoft.com)
- SQL Server - Data Analysis
- PowerBI - Creating reports


### Data Cleaning/Preaparation

In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:
1. Data laoding and inspection
2. Handling missing values
3. Data cleaning and formatting

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA invovled exploring the sales data to answer key question, such as:
- What is the overall sales trend?
- Which products are top sellers?
- What are the peak sales periods?

### Data Analysis

Include some intresting code/features worked with

```sql
SELECT * FROM TABLE 1
WHERE cond = 2;
```

### Results/Findings

The analysis results are summarized as follows:
1. The company's sales have been staedily increasing over the past year, with a noticeable peak during the holiday season.
2. Product Category A is the best performing category in terms of sales and revenue.
3. Customer segments with high lfietime value (LIV) should be targeted for marketing efforts.


### Recommendations

Based on the anaysis, we recommend the following actions:
- Invest in marketing and promotions during peak sales sesaons to maximize revenue.
- Focus on expanding and promoting products in Category A.
- Implement a customer segmenation startegy to target hig LIV customers effectively.

### Limitations

I had to remove all zero values from budget and revenue columns because they would have affected the accuracy of my conclusions from the analysis. There are still a few outliers even after the omissions but even then we can still see that there is a positive correlation between both budget and number of votes with revenue.
